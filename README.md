# Used Car Agency Database Management System

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Used Car Agency Database Management System project. The project aims to create a relational database system to manage information about used cars and dealers in the agency.

## Project Overview

The Used Car Agency Database Management System is designed to facilitate the management of car data and dealership information. The project involves designing and implementing a relational database using MySQL, importing data, and performing data analysis using SQL queries.

## Contents

- `presentation.pptx`: A PowerPoint presentation that provides an overview of the project, including its objectives, database design, data import, and SQL queries used for analysis.

- `Bigdata-HW1...sql`: The SQL code that includes the commands for creating the database tables, setting up primary keys, foreign keys, and performing data analysis using SQL queries.

## Project Steps

1. **Database Design:** The project begins with the design of the relational database. It includes three main tables: `vehicle_information`, `vehicle_consumption`, and `vehicle_patern`. The relationships between these tables are established using primary and foreign keys.

2. **Data Import:** The data from a CSV file is imported into the MySQL database. This step involves populating the tables with relevant information about car attributes and dealers.

3. **SQL Queries and Analysis:** The SQL code includes a series of queries that extract useful insights from the database. These queries answer questions related to the most sold car model, top-selling dealers, average prices, newest and oldest cars, and more.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


2. Open MySQL Workbench or any other MySQL client.

3. Run the `sql_code.sql` script in the MySQL client to create the database tables, set up relationships, and perform data analysis.

## Project Outcome

The Used Car Agency Database Management System demonstrates the process of designing a relational database for a specific scenario, importing data, and performing data analysis using SQL queries. The SQL code provided in this repository showcases the implementation of these steps.

For more details, refer to the `presentation.pptx` and `sql_code.sql` files.
